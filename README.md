1. Log in to your admin account, click on the Admin Panel. You will notice other options appear.

2. Create roles that give different access levels for different groups. Groups help give acces to the agents in each group.

Create a Role:

Go to Admin Panel / Manage / Roles.

Create a new role called System Admins and give them all permissions.

Create a Group:

Go to Admin Panel / Manage / Groups.

Create a group called SYS Admin and assign the System Admins role to this group.

3. Create a Department for system admins.

Go to Admin Panel / Manage / Departments.

Create a new department called SYS Admins.

4. Create a Team
Teams allow you to pull agents from different departments into certain teams.

Go to Admin Panel / Manage / Teams.

Create a team called Warriors.

5. Adjust Ticket Registration Settings
 We want everyone to be able to register tickets.

Go to Admin Panel / Settings / Users.

Make sure the box labeled (Allow users to register tickets) is unchecked.

6. Create Agents
Now we will create a few agents (workers) to assign roles and teams.

Go to Admin Panel / Manage / Agents.

Click on Agents and add a new agent.

Agent 1: Stephen Curry

Role: Superior Admin (full access)

Team: Warriors

Agent 2: Kevin Durant

Role: Support (view access only)

Team: Warriors

Have a record of the email addresses for these agents, so they we can log into them.

7. Create a User
Let's create a user for ticket submission.

Go to the top-right corner and click on Agent Panel.

Navigate to Users and click Add New User.

Create a user with the name Lebron James 

8. Set up SLA (Service Level Agreements)
SLAs are used to notify agents how quickly a ticket should be handled.

Go to Admin Panel / Manage / SLA.

Create the following 3 SLAs:

SEV-A: Critical â€“ HIGH PRIOTITY!!!!

SEV-B: Medium priority

SEV-C: Low priority
